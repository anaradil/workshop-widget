Wrap-up
=======

Fedora Hubs is a very powerful framework and we hope that this workshop gave
you a taste of how easy it can be to create widgets that will simplify your
life as a Fedora contributor.

The main Hubs widget is the activity feed, it will show you someone's
activity throughout the Fedora project, and reload in realtime (now you know
how!). Also know that there are group hubs, that can be a great central point
for a team's activity and communication.

We plan on writing new widgets and improving existing ones to make Fedora
contributor's lives easier and more productive. Join us in the hackfests! :-)
